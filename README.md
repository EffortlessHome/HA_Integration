 EH Home Assistant Integration

Please build the following components. I have included the samples from Home Assistant and the developer guide is here: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_component_index 

- Modules:
	1. Security (priority 1)
  - Step 1: Build the REST Command client (see security.yaml) in this integration component so that the automations are not necessary
  - Build in error handling
  - Expose properties, sensors, state, settings in Home Assistant

 2. Second Home Functionality
    - Calendar
    - Setting lock codes
    - Notifications
	3. Smart Device Integration
    - Alexa, Google, Siri
 4. Monitoring
    - Cameras, AI and person detection
    - Actions to take for sensors (e.g. CO, smoke, water)

5. More modules to come after these...
